# Personal Nix-based ROS devenv

Based on nix-ros-overlay, this is a personal devenv used for ROS2 Kilted development. Includes `rqt`, `gz` (ignition), `nav2`, `amend-cmake`, `turtle`, `slam`, `rviz2` and `ros` packages from the ros flake, among some other prerequisites for building packages.

### Structure

```
.
├── flake.nix                  # Main flake
├── justfile                   # (WIP) Convenience commands
├── profiles/
│   ├── dev                    # Dev profile directory to prevent gc
├── src/                       # Projects go in here (a lot or "src" in the path names)
│   ├── ros-playground/                   
│   │   ├── src/               # Packages in ros-playground
│   ├── <submodule-name>/      # For any future projects
```

### Improvements

There are a couple of improvements that could probably be made:
 - Building submodule packages directly from the root devenv
 - Directly entering a devshell with ROS2 underlay & the local overlay from submodules
 - Storing the submodules/projects in a seperate dir (`projects/` or something)
